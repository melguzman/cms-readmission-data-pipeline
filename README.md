🚑 Healthcare Readmission Reduction Pipeline
A data pipeline to ingest, transform, and visualize CMS Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program (HRRP) data.

This project automates:

✅ Loading HRRP CSV data into SQLite
✅ Data cleaning & transformations using dbt
✅ Analytics & dashboards in Tableau

⚙️ How It Works
1. Data Ingestion
- Source file: hospital_readmissions.csv
- Loaded into SQLite DB table: raw_hospital_readmissions
- Done via Airflow Python task:
```bash
scripts/ingest_hrrp_data.py
```

2. Data Transformation (dbt)
- dbt transforms raw data into clean, analysis-ready tables:
- stg_hospital_readmissions
- hospital_penalties
- penalty_trends
- top_bottom_hospitals

Key transformations include:
- Type casting numeric fields
- Parsing dates into proper formats
- Calculating fiscal years
- Deriving penalty metrics

Run locally:
```bash
cd hrrp_dbt
dbt run
```

3. Dashboard (Tableau)
- Connect Tableau to:
- CSV exports of dbt models
- Visualizations include:
- National map of penalties by state
- Trends in penalties over time
- Filters by medical condition
- Top/bottom 10 hospitals

Note: For Tableau Public, CSV extracts are used instead of live DB connections.

🚀 Running the Pipeline
Prerequisites
- Python 3.10
- Airflow
- dbt-core
- SQLite
- Tableau Desktop (Public Edition)

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run Airflow
Start Airflow:
```bash
airflow standalone
```
Trigger the DAG manually in Airflow UI:
- DAG ID: hrp_ingest_pipeline

Or via CLI:
```bash
airflow dags trigger hrp_ingest_pipeline
```
This will:
✅ Load CSV into SQLite
✅ Run dbt transformations
✅ Generate output CSVs for Tableau

Open Tableau Dashboard
1. Launch Tableau Desktop
2. Open:
```bash
tableau/dashboard.twb
```
3. Explore:
- Maps
- Time trends
- Filters for Top/Bottom hospitals

🗃️ Data Sources
- [CMS Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program](https://data.cms.gov/provider-data/dataset/9n3s-kdb3#overview)

✅ Completed Visuals
✅ National map of penalties by state
✅ Time-series penalty trends
✅ Condition filters (heart failure, pneumonia, etc.)
✅ Top/bottom 10 hospitals by penalties

✨ Future Improvements
- Deploy Airflow & dbt in cloud
- Integrate additional CMS datasets

Quick Start
```bash
# Run pipeline end-to-end:
airflow dags trigger hrp_ingest_pipeline

# OR run dbt manually:
cd hrrp_dbt
dbt run
```
